self-webserver
==============

This project has two aims:

* to be small simple webserver for Self
* to be a testbed and example of how to package Self resources out of the main Self tree

To import this code, run the following from within Self:

  '/path/to/webserver.self' runScript
  
If you are not on the head of the main Self distribution, then you may need to also file in the files in core.
